# Consumer-Activity-Clustering
In this exercise I use clustering in order to segment customers by Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value in order to improve quantitative marketing strategies and to develop commercial strategies. The Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value features for a given customer interaction are analysed in the context of the total cost of service of the interaction. The data set used belongs to a comic book store and is entitled "RFM_data.csv".
